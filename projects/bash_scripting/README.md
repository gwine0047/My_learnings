#!/bin/bash

#echo $SHELL to tell which shell you are using.
#which bash - tells you how you can run bash.

to run a script without using shebang, run the full path /usr/bash/

we use ./ to run a executable because '.' means current directory (i know it's simple but i didn't think about it that way for a long time.)
